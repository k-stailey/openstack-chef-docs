This section will provide you with an overview of the currently supported deployment scenarios for OpenStack. You are probably already familiar with the components for the OpenStack 'Essex' release:




-  :doc:`Compute All-in-One </architecture/allinone>`: A full OpenStack Compute deployment on a single host.
-  :doc:`Compute Single Controller + N Compute </architecture/1+n>`: A single Controller with 1 or more Nova Compute nodes.

OpenStack is very flexible, so additional configurations will continue to be supported in the future.
