AllInOne
==========

**AllInOne** configurations are appropriate for small scale environments like proof of concept projects, dedicated fenced development environments, or when the host will be a virtual machine. This is a good way to familiarize yourself with the basics of OpenStack.

In an **AllInOne** configuration, all of the components of OpenStack are installed together (minus Swift Object Storage). This machine need not be large, but sufficient to launch a few virtual instances.
