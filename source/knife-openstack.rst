Knife OpenStack

https://github.com/opscode/knife-openstack

This is the official Opscode Knife plugin for OpenStack Compute (Nova). This plugin gives knife the ability to create, bootstrap and manage instances in OpenStack Compute clouds. It has been tested against the Diablo and Essex releases in configurations using Keystone against the OpenStack API (as opposed to the EC2 API).
